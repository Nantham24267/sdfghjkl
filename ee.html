    <pre><p><b>ENVIRONMENTAL  EFFECTS</b>

        <b>GOOD</b>

        Installing solar panels for domestic use can have many positive
        environmental effects, including: 
        •	Reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
        Solar panels don't produce greenhouse gases, which contribute to 
        climate change. 
        •   Improving air quality 
        Solar panels don't produce harmful emissions like sulfur dioxide, 
        nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds. 
        •  Reducing water use 
        Solar panels can reduce water usage for energy production. According
        to Duke University, a US household can save over 61,000 liters of water
        per year by installing solar panels. 
        •  Mitigating climate change 
        Solar energy can help mitigate the effects of climate change, such
        as rising sea levels, more severe weather events, and temperature
        and precipitation patterns. 
        •   Conserving water 
        Traditional energy sources like coal and natural gas use a lot of
        water for cooling and power generation. 
        • Preserving natural habitats 
        Solar panels can be elevated or installed on water to minimize their
        impact on the land. 
        •  Strengthening energy grids 
        Solar panels can help strengthen energy grids so they can withstand 
        natural disasters. 


<b>BAD</b>

 Energy Demand - Solar requires a significant amount of energy up front to produce.
Mining, manufacturing and transportation all require substantial amounts energy. 
Quartz must be processed, and cleaned and then manufactured with other components
which may come from different facilities (aluminum, copper etc..) to produce a single solar module.
eating the quartz during the processing stage requires very high heat.  
Manufacturing requires combining multiple materials with incredible precision to produce 
high efficiency panels.
All of this requires lots of up-front energy. 
With traditional fuels such as gas or goal, they are extracted, cleaned/processed and burned at 
very large scales, typically in a single location.  
 2.      Chemicals – To produce solar-grade silicon, semi-conductor processing typically involves hazardous chemicals.  
 Depending on the solar panel manufacturer and country of origin, these chemicals may or may not be disposed properly.  
 Like every industry, there are companies leading by example, and others which cut corners to save cash.  
 Not every company will dump chemicals, or won’t recycle their byproducts properly, but there are bad apples out there.
 3.      Recycling – What happens when solar panels break or are decommissioned?  Although solar panel recycling has not 
 become a major issue yet, it will in the coming decades as solar panels need to be replaced. Currently, solar modules 
 can be disposed of with other standard e-waste. Countries without robust e-waste disposal means are at a higher risk of 
 recycling related issues.
