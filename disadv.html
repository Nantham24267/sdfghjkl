    <h4><i>Solar Energy</i></h4>
    <pre><p><b>DISADVANTAGES</b>

        • Cost: The initial cost of installing solar panels is high,
          including the cost of the panels, inverters, batteries, wiring,
          and installation.<br>
        • Weather dependence: Solar panels are dependent on sunlight, so 
          they are less efficient on cloudy or rainy days and can't generate 
          energy at night.<br> 
        • Space requirements: Installing enough solar panels to meet your 
          energy needs can require a lot of space, which may not be available 
          on your roof or in your yard.<br>
        • Energy storage: Storing solar energy in batteries to use at night can
          be expensive. <br>
        • Incentive expiration: Incentive programs for solar panels have 
        expiration dates, so waiting to install could mean missing out on incentives. <br>
        • Not ideal for moving: Solar panels are not ideal if you plan on moving house.
